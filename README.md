<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Kishore 👋</h1>

<p align="center">
  I build things that solve real problems. Whether it's machine learning, backend APIs, or sensor-driven systems — I focus on projects that matter.

## 🛠 About Me

- 🧠 I think in code and build by experimenting.
- 🚀 I like shipping things fast — MVPs, demos, real-world solutions.
- 🔍 I avoid noise. If it's not practical or insightful, it's not on my radar.
- 🌐 I enjoy working across full-stack systems, but lean into AI, automation, and data.
- 🧰 I'm tool-agnostic — I use what gets the job done.

## 💬 Philosophy

> *Build fast. Learn fast. Iterate in public.*  
> I’m not into chasing buzzwords. I care about clarity, speed, and results. If you’re building something interesting or want to collaborate — let’s talk.
